He can save them, publish them or else.</p><h2 id="Seeing-is-believing"><a href="#Seeing-is-believing" class="headerlink" title="Seeing is believing"></a>Seeing is believing</h2><p>To analyze this fact I did a <em>sniffing</em> with <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wireshark</a>.</p><p>see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></p><blockquote><p>A packet analyzer (also known as a network analyzer, protocol analyzer or packet sniffer—or, for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer) is a computer program or piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network or part of a network.</p></blockquote><p>To intercept my friends’ stories I connected the computer and the smartphone to the same wifi network. Then I opened Wireshark.</p><p><em>I saw all my network data that was not encrypted.</em></p><p>At this time I opened Instagram and clicked on my friend’s story.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/Instagram-doesn-t-encrypt-stories/img00_ok.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Image in the stories"></p><p>After that I searched for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP</a> requests that WireShark had sniffed from the net and <strong>I found the resources corresponding to the stories I had looked at on the smartphone!</strong></p><p><img src="/images/posts/Instagram-doesn-t-encrypt-stories/img01_ok.png" alt="alt text" title="Sniffing"></p><p>For the most experienced..<br>The data obtained with WireShark containing the stories was like this<br>GET /codes_numbers.jpg HTTP/1.1 for images<br>GET /codes_numbers.mp4 HTTP/1.1 for videos</p><p>So I could find the <em>full request URI</em> containing the direct link to the contents.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/Instagram-doesn-t-encrypt-stories/img02_ok.png" alt="alt text" title="Content Analysis"><br><img src="/images/posts/Instagram-doesn-t-encrypt-stories/img03_ok.png" alt="alt text" title="Content Image"></p><h2 id="Self-destruction"><a href="#Self-destruction" class="headerlink" title="Self-destruction"></a>Self-destruction</h2><p>In the following days I kept the contents under control and I could verify that the images and videos were deleted only after 3 days.</p><h2 id="Alternative-Stories’-Apps"><a href="#Alternative-Stories’-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Alternative Stories’ Apps"></a>Alternative Stories’ Apps</h2><p>The procedure is not applicable with Snapchat, Facebook and Whatsapp because they use an encrypted protocol: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TLS</a>.</p><h2 id="Video-demo"><a href="#Video-demo" class="headerlink" title="Video demo"></a>Video demo</h2><iframe width="100%" height="355" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jHUwCL9oRbQ?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>Article for information purposes.
